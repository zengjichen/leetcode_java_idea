Approach 2: Partitions + Dynamic Programming
(Note: This solution is extremely challenging, but is a natural consequence of trying to enumerate the playlists in this manner.)

Intuition

Since we are interested in playing every song at least once, let's keep track of what times x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots)x=(x 
1,x 2 ,⋯) a song was played that wasn't yet played before. For example, if we have 5 songs abcde, and we play abacabdcbaeacbd, then x = (1, 2, 4, 7, 11)x=(1,2,4,7,11) as these are the first occurrences of a unique song. For convenience, we'll also put x_{N+1} = L+1x 
N+1 =L+1. Our strategy is to count the number of playlists \#_x# x
​that satisfy this xx, so that our final answer will be \sum \#_x∑# x
